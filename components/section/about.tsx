            Founded in 2015, Mocking by Jay emerged from the underground rap scene with a simple mission: 
            give raw talent a platform without compromising artistic integrity. What started as a basement 
            studio and a dream has grown into one of the most respected independent labels in the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            We've built our reputation by staying true to the streets while delivering professional-grade 
            production. Every artist we sign isn't just a contract—they're family. We provide the resources, 
            the guidance, and the freedom to create music that matters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Mocking by Jay represents a roster of diverse voices united by one thing: an unshakeable 
            commitment to keeping it real. From trap to conscious rap, from up-and-comers to established names, 
            we're building a legacy that future generations will respect.
